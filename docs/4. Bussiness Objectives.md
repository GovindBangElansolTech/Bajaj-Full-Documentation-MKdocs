# **Bussiness Objectives**
## ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**
1. **Ensure Quality Control**:        
**a**. Guarantee that only the correct parts for each variant (Pro, Premium, Urban) are used during assembly.       
**b**. Detect and prevent assembly errors such as missing or incorrect parts in real-time.

2. **Minimize Production Downtime** :         
**a**. Automatically identify issues during assembly and stop production.           
**b**. Provide manual override options for operators to bypass non-critical errors and continue production efficiently.

3.**Enhance Defect Tracking and Reporting** :            
**a**. Deliver detailed reports on missing part, incorrect variants, and bypassed parts for post-production analysis.           
**b**. Highlight defects visually with clear indications of the issue and its location (e.g., through red-highlighted cameras).

4. **Optimize Variant-Specific Assembly** :                       
**a**. Ensure that each chamber only handles parts for the designated variant and prevent cross-variant contamination.                  
**b**. Support easy updates for adding new variants to the system when required.

5. **Empower Supervisors with Control and Flexibility**:             
**a**. Enable supervisors to manage production exceptions, bypass non-critical defects, and control variant updates.                
**b**. Provide a user-friendly interface to monitor, intervene, and manage assembly processes seamlessly.               

6. **Improve Production Efficiency** :            
**a**. Reduce errors and rework through AI-driven monitoring and detection.                                     
**b**. Allow for flexible assembly operations without compromising quality standards.             

7. **Future-Proof the Assembly Process**  :             
**a**. Accommodate the integration of new variants or components with minimal disruption.               
**b**. Provide a scalable solution that adapts to evolving production needs.

## ðŸ’¡ **Objectives** 
1. **Accurate Part Verification** :               
Implement AI algorithms to verify that only the correct components are used for each specific variant (Pro, Premium, Urban) during assembly.

2. **Real-Time Issue Detection** :            
Deploy a robust vision system to identify missing or incorrect parts immediately, halting the assembly line to prevent further errors.          

3. **Seamless Exception Handling** :          
Provide manual override options, such as a "Pass This Kit" button and part-specific bypass controls, to ensure production continuity when non-critical issues arise.            

4. **Comprehensive Reporting** :          
Generate detailed reports documenting defects, missing parts, incorrect variants, and bypassed components for process improvement and quality assurance.                

5. ***Variant-Specific Chambers*** :
Designate chambers equipped with AI-monitored cameras to manage parts for individual variants, ensuring no cross-variant contamination.

6. ***Camera-Based Inspection*** :              
Use eight cameras per chamber to monitor multiple components simultaneously, highlighting missing parts and identifying errors with precise camera location indicators.

7. ***Production Efficiency*** :            
Reduce assembly downtime by allowing supervisors to make informed decisions about bypassing or addressing detected issues quickly.

8. ***User-Friendly Interface*** :                     
Provide a clear, intuitive interface for operators and supervisors to monitor and manage the assembly process, detect issues, and implement corrective actions.

9. ***Scalability and Adaptability*** :            
Develop the system to be scalable for future expansion and adaptable to accommodate new product variants and assembly line changes.
