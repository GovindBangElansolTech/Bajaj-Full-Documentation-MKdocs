# Technology Used
## **üñ•Ô∏è Frontend**
### **Material UI**:
Material UI is a React UI framework that provides pre-designed components based on Google‚Äôs Material Design. It was used to speed up the development process and create a visually consistent and responsive interface for the dashboard. With Material UI, we can easily implement components like buttons, tables, forms, and grids, all while maintaining a modern look and feel.

### **React Router**:
React Router is used for dynamic routing within the React application. It allows for smooth transitions between pages, such as defect logs, reports, and real-time status dashboards. By using React Router, we can create a single-page application (SPA) that doesn‚Äôt require full-page reloads, ensuring a fast and seamless user experience for supervisors and operators.

### **TypeScript**:
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the codebase, helping to catch errors early in the development process. It was chosen to improve code quality and maintainability, making it easier to manage the growing complexity of the application. TypeScript enhances developer productivity with better tooling support, such as autocompletion, error checking, and refactoring.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Backend**
### **Node.js** :
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed for building scalable network applications. It is used for handling server-side logic in this project, allowing for efficient and high-performance handling of asynchronous requests and real-time communication.

### **Express.js** : 
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications. It is used for building RESTful APIs in the backend, handling routing, middleware, and facilitating the integration of the dashboard and AI systems.

### **TypeScript** :
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which improves code quality and developer productivity by catching errors early. It is used in the backend to enhance the maintainability and scalability of the application, especially for complex systems like handling real-time data and interactions with the AI system.

### **TypeORM** :
TypeORM is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for TypeScript and JavaScript. It is used to interact with the MySQL database in an object-oriented way, allowing developers to query the database and manage data models without writing raw SQL queries. TypeORM simplifies database operations, making it easier to work with complex data models and relationships.

## üóÑÔ∏è**Database** :
### **MySQL** :
MySQL is a relational database management system that will be used to store structured data for the system. This includes production logs, defect records, variant configurations, and user data. MySQL provides reliability, scalability, and strong transactional support for managing this data.
