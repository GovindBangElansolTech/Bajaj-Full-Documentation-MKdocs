# **Assumption and Constraints**

##  üõ†Ô∏è **Assumption** 
### **1. General Assumptions** : 
**a.** The assembly process for all three variants (Pro, Premium, Urban) follows a standardized workflow.           
**b.** Cameras and vision systems are pre-calibrated and positioned optimally to detect all relevant components.            
**c.** Operators and supervisors are trained to use the system, including dashboards, bypass controls, and report generation tools.             

### **2. For the Software Team (Dashboard Development)**
**a.** Data from the vision system will be provided in a structured and standardized format for integration into the dashboard.             
**b.** The dashboard interface will primarily be used by operators and supervisors with minimal technical expertise.            
**c.** All input data for the dashboard, such as defect logs and bypass actions, will be transmitted in real time from the vision system.           
**d.** User roles and permissions for accessing dashboard features will be defined beforehand.              
**e.** The dashboard will operate on pre-configured hardware and software environments provided by the project infrastructure team.         

### **3. For the Vision Team (Database and AI Development)**
**a.** Each chamber will house 8 cameras capable of detecting multiple components per camera, with adequate resolution and field of view.           
**b.** AI algorithms will be trained on an extensive dataset that includes all possible parts and variants for accurate detection.          
**c.** Variant-specific parts will be clearly distinguishable by the AI based on their physical characteristics.            
**d.** The database will maintain an up-to-date list of all valid parts, components, and their configurations for each variant.         
**e.** New variants can only be introduced into the system after their specifications and components are added to the database and AI model.            
**f.** A single variant will be assembled in a chamber at any given time.       

### **4. Technical Assumptions**
**a.** The vision system's defect detection accuracy will meet or exceed 99.5% in ideal conditions.             
**b.** The system will have adequate computing resources to process camera feeds and run AI models in real time without delays.             
**c.** Network connectivity between the vision system, database, and dashboard will be reliable and fast enough to support real-time operations.        
**d.** Logs and reports will be stored securely, adhering to company policies and industry standards.           

### **5. Operational Assumptions**
**a.** The "Bypass Vision System" and "Pass This Kit" features will be used judiciously by operators to minimize disruptions to production.         
**b.**Supervisors will oversee and approve actions related to bypassing defects or disabling the vision system.         
**c.**Any hardware or software issues will be resolved by the respective maintenance teams within predefined SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

##  üîó **Constraints** 
### **1. General Constraints** :
**Budget** : The project has a predefined budget for hardware, software, and personnel resources. Exceeding this limit may require additional approvals.                    
**Timeline** : The system must be implemented within a fixed timeframe to align with production schedules.                      
**Hardware Availability** : The number of cameras, chambers, and computing resources is fixed based on initial planning and may not be increased during the project.

### **2.Technical Constraints** : 
**Processing Power** : The computing hardware has fixed specifications, and upgrades are not allowed during the project. AI models must be optimized to work within these limits.           
**Network Dependency** : The system's performance is highly dependent on a stable and high-speed network connection between the vision system, database, and dashboard.         
**Data Storage** : The storage system has predefined capacity limits for defect logs, bypass actions, and reports. Overutilization may require data archiving or deletion.          

### **3. Operational Constraints**
**Single Variant Assembly** : Only one variant (Pro, Premium, or Urban) can be assembled in a chamber at any given time.                        
**Manual Actions** : Certain actions, such as bypassing defects or introducing new variants, require manual intervention and approval from supervisors.                                   
**System Uptime** : The system must operate continuously during production shifts, with minimal downtime for maintenance or updates.

### **4. Security Constraints** 
**Access Control** : Only authorized personnel can access dashboards, bypass controls, and variant management tools.            
**Data Sensitivity** : All defect and production data must be encrypted to comply with company and industry data security standards.
