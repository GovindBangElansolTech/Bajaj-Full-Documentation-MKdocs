## ðŸ’¡ **Key Features** 

1. **Variant-Specific Inspection** :      
**a**. The AI system validates that only the components for the designated variant (Pro, Premium, or Urban) are used.     
**b**. If components from another variant are detected, the system flags it as a defect.

2. **Missing Part Detection** :           
**a**. Assembly Line has chamber houses cameras, with multiple components inspected simultaneously.                       
**b**. If any part is missing, the system displays the part name, its location, and the specific camera where the issue was detected.       
**c**. The camera with the detected defect is highlighted in red on the inspection screen.

3. **Manual Override Controls** :             
**a**. **Pass this Kit** : If the supervisor decides to continue production despite missing or incorrect parts, they can manually press the "Pass this Kit" button. For instance, if 10 parts are missing for a Premium variant, pressing this button 10 times allows production to proceed without delay.       
**b**. **Bypass Part** : The inspection screen lists all parts as interactive buttons. Supervisors can click on a part's button to bypass its inspection. Bypassed parts are highlighted in grey in part list to indicate they are intentionally skipped.        
**c**. **Bypass Vision System** : If a new variant needs to run without being added to the AI system, the supervisor can press this button to bypass the vision inspection. The system generates a defect report for the unrecognized variant for further analysis.

4. **Error Reporting** :             
**a**. The system provides real-time reporting of defects, including missing parts, incorrect components, and variant mismatches.                        
**b**. Supervisors receive detailed visual feedback, allowing them to identify and address issues quickly.        

5. **Variant Management** :                       
**a**. The system supports three pre-configured variants (Pro, Premium, Urban). If a new variant needs to be added, it must be registered in the AI system to avoid defect alerts.              
**b**. Running unregistered variants without adding them to the AI system will trigger a defect notification unless Bypass Vision System is activated.         

5. **Camera-Based Component Monitoring** :            
**a**. Eight cameras in each variant-specific chamber monitor the assembly process, identifying and verifying the presence of multiple components.          
**b**. Missing or incorrect parts and part mismatch are highlighted in red on the systemâ€™s visual display to easily pinpoint issues.
