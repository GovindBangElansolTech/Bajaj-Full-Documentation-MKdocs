# **Scope**
   
## 1. 🔍 **Variant-Specific Inspection** :                  
**a**. The system verifies that only the designated components for the selected variant (Pro, Premium, or Urban) are used.              
**b**. It flags any part belonging to a different variant as a defect, ensuring no cross-variant component usage.               

## 2. ⚠️ **Component Detection and Reporting** :                
**a**. Equipped with cameras in chamber, the system inspects multiple components simultaneously.                
**b**. It detects missing and mismatch parts and variant mismatch, highlights them on the screen, and marks the corresponding camera in red.            

## 3.  👁️ **Manual Override Features** :
**a**. Supervisors have manually bypass issues using the "Pass this Kit" button to continue production.             
**b**. Individual parts can be bypassed selectively through the part list screen, where bypassed parts appear in grey.              
**c**. The "Bypass Vision System" button allows supervisors to run unregistered variants while generating a defect report for analysis.             

## 4. 🖇️ **Variant Management** : 
**a**. Supports pre-configured variants (Pro, Premium, Urban). New variants must be registered in the AI system to ensure proper inspection.             
**b**. If an unrecognized variant is running, the system will consider it as defect and stop the production.               

## 5. 📄 **Error Visualization and Reporting:** : 
**a**. Real-time visual feedback is provided for missing, incorrect, or bypassed components.              
**b**. defect and bypass reports are generated for supervisors to analyze and improve production processes.      

## 6. 📈 **Improved Efficiency and Flexibility** :
**a**. Reduces production downtime caused by manual checks.             
**b**. Enables supervisors to make quick decisions without halting the assembly line unnecessarily.
