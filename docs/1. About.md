# About

## 🗂️ **Overview**
The Bajaj Chetak Assembly Inspection AI System is designed to optimize the production process of three scooter variants: Pro, Premium, and Urban. This AI-powered system ensures that the correct parts are used for each variant during assembly, detects any missing components, and offers real-time defect management.

## 🗂️ **Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to implement an intelligent inspection system that ensures:          
1. Accurate assembly of Bajaj Chetak variants by detecting incorrect or missing components in real-time.                        
2. Reduction in production errors and defective products, leading to improved customer satisfaction and cost efficiency.            
3. Seamless production flow with supervisor-enabled overrides to handle known issues without halting operations unnecessarily.              
4. Compliance with strict variant-specific configurations to maintain product integrity and consistency.
